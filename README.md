# Social-Network-Analyses Research Seminar: Explorative Analyses of a Gene-Disease Network

## Abstract



In medicine and biology, the reason why diseases occur is a highly researched topic. One of the reasons why a disease occurs is the mutation of genes. Nevertheless, so many genes are associated with only one disease. This work is aimed to analyze a gene-disease network to observe a unique number of genes that are responsible for a particular group of diseases. To do this, a gene-disease network and its corresponding projection networks have been generated.  It could be noted from the networks that mutations with specific genes might result in various diseases that are related to these genes. Patients having a certain disease also have a higher chance of getting another one. Lastly, the reasons of the connection between diseases or genes themselves were found and illustrated.
